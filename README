With this toolset, you can install docker and easily fire up your dev environment.
 - drupal 7
 - SSL support
 - PHP5.4 (based on debian 7)
 - Apache 2.2
 - one MySQL container for all projects
 - one Drupal 7 container + hostname per project
 - one Solr container for all projects

 Install docker:
   curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh

 Add yourself to docker group
   sudo usermod -aG docker [YOUR USER]

 Then, logout your system and login again

 Run bin/d7-docker-install-scripts.sh to symlink all needed scripts to your bin folder.

 Available commands:
  - d7-build-docker-image : Build / rebuild the drupal 7 docker image
  - d7-start              : start drupal 7 container from project folder
  - d7-stop               : stop container for 'this' project
  - d7-mysql-start        : start mysql container (triggered by d7-start)
  - d7-mysql-stop         : stop mysql container
  - d7-solr4-start        : start solr4 container (triggered by d7-start)
  - d7-solr4-stop         : stop solr4 container
  - d7-status             : shows all docker containers (running and stopped)
  - d7-stop-all           : stop all drupal 7 containers
  - d7-cleanup            : Cleanup (stop + remove) all drupal 7 containers.
                          : They are disposable, and usually removed immediately
                          : when you stop a d7 container.

 To start your project, go to the project folder, and run 'd7-start'
 Note that settings.php must contain the mysql-host 'mysql-docker.dev',
 and that solr is reachable at solr4-docker.dev:8983/solr or localhost:8983 from each drupal container.

 Custom docker stuff per project:
   Add file .d7-docker.conf to your project folder.

   !! Be aware that any bash code in this file is actually executed !!

   Example content of file:

   # Add dependency container.
   # Format: [container name]:[start-script/command]
   # CUST_DEPENDENCIES=(
   #   "docker.mysql:${mydir}/d7-mysql-start.sh"
   #   "docker.solr4:${mydir}/d7-solr4-start.sh"
   # )
   #
   # Add custom link between containers.
   # Format: [dependency container name]:[hostname in 'this' container, mapped to dependency]
   # CUST_LINK=(
   #   "docker.mysql:mysql-docker.dev"
   #   "docker.solr4:solr4-docker.dev"
   # )
   #
   # Mount extra volumes in container.
   # Format: [local folder]:[folder in container]
   # CUST_VOL="/opt/simplesamlphp:/opt/simplesamlphp1"
   #
   # Do not check if this is actually Drupal. Usable for 'other' php apps to be ran in
   # a D7 container.
