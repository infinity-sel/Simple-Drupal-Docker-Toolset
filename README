With this toolset, you can install docker and easily fire up your dev environment.
 - drupal 7
 - SSL support
 - PHP5.4 (based on debian 7)
 - Apache 2.2
 - one MySQL container for all projects
 - one Drupal 7 container + hostname per project
 - one Solr container for all projects

 Install docker:
   curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh

 Add yourself to docker group
   sudo usermod -aG docker [YOUR USER]

 Then, logout your system and login again

 Run bin/d7-docker-install-scripts.sh to symlink all needed scripts to your bin folder.

 Available commands:
  - d7-build-docker-image : Build / rebuild the drupal 7 docker image
  - d7-start              : start drupal 7 container from project folder
  - d7-stop               : stop container for 'this' project
  - d7-mysql-start        : start mysql container (triggered by d7-start)
  - d7-mysql-stop         : stop mysql container
  - d7-solr4-start        : start solr4 container (triggered by d7-start)
  - d7-solr4-stop         : stop solr4 container
  - d7-status             : shows all docker containers (running and stopped)
  - d7-stop-all           : stop all drupal 7 containers
  - d7-cleanup            : Cleanup (stop + remove) all drupal 7 containers.
                          : They are disposable, and usually removed immediately
                          : when you stop a d7 container.

 To start your project, go to the project folder, and run 'd7-start'
 Note that settings.php must contain the mysql-host 'mysql-docker.dev',
 and that solr is reachable at solr4-docker.dev:8983/solr or localhost:8983 from each drupal container.
